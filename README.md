# Vue Vite filter texts application
This is a simple application to filter the texts from a JSON file.
I created this one for learning Vue3.

I also re-wrote the [guide](https://learnvue.co/2020/12/setting-up-your-first-vue3-project-vue-3-0-release/) from `learnvue.com` and summarized it on my notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/harryphung/Creating-your-first-Vue-3-project-b39f48343e8d41f5b9627372e3d4c8a9).
